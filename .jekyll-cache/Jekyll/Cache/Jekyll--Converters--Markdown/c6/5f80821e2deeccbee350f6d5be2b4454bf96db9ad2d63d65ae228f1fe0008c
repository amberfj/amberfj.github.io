I"*<p>Curator Lee Plested commission AFJD to design an installation for <em>Primary Research Lab</em>, an exhibition of seminal minimalist works on paper from the print collection of Western Gallery at Western Washington University, with responses by contemporary artists and designers.  Artists in the exhibition included Agnes Martin, Richard Serra, Joseph Albers and Jo Baer, among others. AFJDâ€™s contribution, entitled <em>Mycobench</em> was fabricated from an advanced biodegradable biocomposite material consisting of a blend of mushroom spores and sawdust. The honeycomb design reflects a fabrication process in which individually moulded hexagonal blocks are grown together to produce larger forms, which were then dried to produce furniture that was installed in the main space of Western Gallery.</p>
