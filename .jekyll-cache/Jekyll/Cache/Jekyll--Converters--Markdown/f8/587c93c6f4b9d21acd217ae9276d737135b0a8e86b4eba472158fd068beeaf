I"<p><em>Charismata</em> is an AD-Node Grand NCE affiliated research project I initiated to examine the persuasive potential of aesthetic experience in the contemporary data-saturated condition. The research-based artwork uses the Karolinska Emotional Directed Faces Database to explore the changing role of charisma as it is decoupled from physical presence and finds its way into the mediated channels of the Internet. The project engages with data that seeks to quantify the aesthetic impact of human faces on emotive decision-making.</p>
