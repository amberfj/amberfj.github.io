I":<p><em>They Grow Without Us</em> was an installation of biodegradable public furniture on the UBC campus by AFJD that engages innovative interdisciplinary research at the intersection of materials science and design. The pieces consist of honeycomb-shaped public furniture grown from mushrooms. A blend of mushroom spores and sawdust were cultivated in moulds, which are then dried to produce solid objects. The honeycomb design of the seating reflects a fabrication process in which individually moulded hexagonal blocks are grown together to produce larger forms.</p>
