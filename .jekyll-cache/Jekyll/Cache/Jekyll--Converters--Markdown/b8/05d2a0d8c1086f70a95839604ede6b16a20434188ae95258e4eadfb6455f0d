I"[<p>AFJD is the design studio of Amber Frid-Jimenez and Joe Dahmen. The studio is positioned at the intersection of architecture and information design. Our transdisciplinary approach engages advanced technology to create conceptually rigorous virtual and environmentally sustainable built environments. Our practice is eclectic and multidimensional, which reflects the changing culture of design and technology. We invent new processes and create social and political situations around the design of architecture, information design, and social media.</p>

<p>We have been working together for fifteen years. Much of that time we have been in Boston, where we stayed after finishing degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2012, we relocated to Vancouver and travel back and forth to Norway and the Netherlands for research and projects.</p>
