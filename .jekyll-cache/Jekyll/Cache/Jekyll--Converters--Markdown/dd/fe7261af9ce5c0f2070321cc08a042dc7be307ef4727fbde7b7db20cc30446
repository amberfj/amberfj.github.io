I"ø<p><em>New Cloud Atlas: Data as Place</em> is an open-source participatory online platform that maps physical infrastructure of the Internet. The project is a global effort to map each data place that makes up the cloud in an open and accountable way. We have set out to find and map each warehouse data centre, each internet exchange, each connecting cable and switch. The goal is to observe anything of physical significance in the operation of the cloud and record it for everyone to see and use.</p>
