I"›<p><em>Data Is Political</em> was a two day symposium and workshop at the Bergen National Academy of Art &amp; Design in Norway that investigated the relationship betweeen art, design, and the politics of information. The event brought together artists, designers and scientists to discuss the aesthetic, ethical and spatial dimensions of information and its relation to power, the production of knowledge, and the construction of urban spaces.  I conceived of the project and invited Ben Dalton, Senior Lecturer at Leeds Met University in the UK to collaborate on the organization of the symposium, which was accompanied by an exhibition, workshop, and archive.</p>
