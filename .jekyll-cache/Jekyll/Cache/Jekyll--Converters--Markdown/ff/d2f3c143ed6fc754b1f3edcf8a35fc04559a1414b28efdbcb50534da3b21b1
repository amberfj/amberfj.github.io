I"w<p><em>Mycelium Mock-up</em> is an architectural installation by AFJD that explores the role of biotechnology in the future of design. The installation consists of a two channel video projected on a screen constructed of sawdust and mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms. This thread-like fungus plays an essential role in natural world, aiding in the decomposition of materials and converting them to biologically available elements. In the case of Mycelium Mock-up, a local strain of mycelium is used as a binder that creates an advanced bio-composite projection screen that is partially edible and  fully biodegradable.</p>
