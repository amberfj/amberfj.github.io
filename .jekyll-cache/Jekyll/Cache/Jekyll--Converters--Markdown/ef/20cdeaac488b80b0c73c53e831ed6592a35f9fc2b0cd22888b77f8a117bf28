I"<p><em>This is Not a Test</em> was an installation commissioned by Daina Augaitis, Bruce Grenville and Stephanie Rebick, curators for the <em>MashUp: The Birth of Modern Culture</em> exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery, which was open from February to June, 2016. A room on the first floor was dedicated to the installation, which was a part of “The Digital Age: Hacking, Remix, and the Archive” portion of the exhibition. I was also invited to contribute a book chapter for the catalogue that accompanied the exhibition.</p>
