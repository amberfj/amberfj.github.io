I"/<p><em>Pop Rocks</em> is a temporary architectural installation commissioned by the City of Vancouver transformed a block of Robson Street in downtown Vancouver during the summer of 2012. <em>Pop Rocks</em> is a radically experimental temporary design that borrows post-industrial waste on its way to be recycled.
<em>Pop Rocks</em> deploys fifteen large pillow-like forms, made from post-industrial waste, across a city block to create an alien landscape that offers a soft place to rest while inhabiting a monumental presence at the centre of the city.</p>
