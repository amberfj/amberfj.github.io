I"<p><em>Reading Vogue</em> is a short video I created and presented at “Questioning Aesthetics,” a symposium organized by Michael Kelly, editor of the <em>Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, 2nd edition</em> (Oxford University Press). The symposium was held at the Pratt Institute in New York in September, 2014. The video relates to my essay on ‘data visualization’ for the <em>Encyclopedia</em>. My presentation was followed by a panel discussion in which I participated with Christiane Paul and Boris Groys.</p>

<p>The video consists of the complete December 2012 Paris issue of <em>Vogue</em>. I wrote a custom computer program to detect faces within the spreads. A visual script draws a graphic mask over each face indicating the relationship between facial features. A video is generated such that the pages turn sequentially from front to back. The piece is a commentary on the use of data collection, analysis and visualization by technology companies and research institutions to find patterns and predict trends.</p>
