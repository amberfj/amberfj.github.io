*Reading Vogue* is a short video I created and presented at “Questioning Aesthetics,” a symposium organized by Michael Kelly, editor of the *Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, 2nd edition* (Oxford University Press). The symposium was held at the Pratt Institute in New York in September, 2014. The video relates to my essay on ‘data visualization’ for the *Encyclopedia*. My presentation was followed by a panel discussion in which I participated with Christiane Paul and Boris Groys.

The video consists of the complete December 2012 Paris issue of *Vogue*. I wrote a custom computer program to detect faces within the spreads. A visual script draws a graphic mask over each face indicating the relationship between facial features. A video is generated such that the pages turn sequentially from front to back. The piece is a commentary on the use of data collection, analysis and visualization by technology companies and research institutions to find patterns and predict trends.
