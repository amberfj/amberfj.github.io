Pop Rocks, a temporary architectural installation commissioned by the City of Vancouver transformed a block of Robson Street in downtown Vancouver during the summer of 2012. Pop Rocks is a radically experimental temporary design that borrows post-industrial waste on its way to be recycled.
Pop Rocks deploys fifteen large pillow-like forms, made from post-industrial waste, across a city block to create an alien landscape that offers a soft place to rest while inhabiting a monumental presence at the centre of the city. 

Pop Rocks is radically sustainable, responding to the City of Vancouverâ€™s ambition to become the greenest city in the world by 2020. The installation is constructed entirely from re-used materials that will be recycled at the end of the project. Each of the soft forms is sewn from recyled teflon-coated fiberglass fabric provided from the refurbishment of the tensile membrane roof of Canada Place, a local iconic building. Pieces of the roof were sewn by a local sailmaker into shapes that were filled with recycled polystyrene beads provided by Mansonville Plastics, a company that recycles polystyrene from throughout Metro Vancouver. Pop Rocks design methodology marks a departure from traditional top-down design methods towards a contingent, emergent, and tactical design ethos. 

Free and open to the public.
