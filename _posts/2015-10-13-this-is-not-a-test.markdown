This is Not a Test was an installation commissioned by Daina Augaitis, Bruce Grenville and Stephanie Rebick, curators for the MashUp: The Birth of Modern Culture exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery, which was open from February to June, 2016. A room on the first floor was dedicated to the installation, which was a part of “The Digital Age: Hacking, Remix, and the Archive” portion of the exhibition. I was also invited to contribute a book chapter for the catalogue that accompanied the exhibition.

The installation consisted of an industrial scale mobile that incorporated objects and images from the unseen world of image processing and digital computation. A process of material exploration, experimentation, and conceptual research into the topic of the aesthetics and politics of image processing and artificial intelligence preceded the production of the art work. The piece occupied a 20’ x 20’ gallery and was situated next to installations by Hito Steyerl, Isa Genzken, Stan Douglas, Elizabeth Price, and others.
